Electrical energy can be transferred between separate coils without a metallic (conductive) connection between the two circuits. Faraday's law of induction, discovered in 1831, describes the induced voltage effect in any coil due to a changing magnetic flux encircled by the coil.\n",

      "Leakage flux [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideal transformer model assumes that all flux generated by the primary winding links all the turns of every winding, including itself. In practice, some flux traverses paths that take it outside the windings.[11] Such flux is termed leakage flux, and results in leakage inductance in series with the mutually coupled transformer windings.[12] Leakage flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply. It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.[11] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit the short-circuit current it will supply.[12] Leaky transformers may be used to supply loads that exhibit negative resistance, such as electric arcs, mercury- and sodium- vapor lamps and neon signs or for safely handling loads that become periodically short-circuited such as electric arc welders.[9]:485\n",
      "\n",
      "Air gaps are also used to keep a transformer from saturating, especially audio-frequency transformers in circuits that have a DC component flowing in the windings.[13] A saturable reactor exploits saturation of the core to control alternating current.\n",
      "\n",
      "Knowledge of leakage inductance is also useful when transformers are operated in parallel. It can be shown that if the percent impedance [d] and associated winding leakage reactance-to-resistance (X/R) ratio of two transformers were the same, the transformers would share the load power in proportion to their respective ratings. However, the impedance tolerances of commercial transformers are significant. Also, the impedance and X/R ratio of different capacity transformers tends to vary.[15]\n",

Magnetizing current is in phase with the flux, the relationship between the two being non-linear due to saturation effects. However, all impedances of the equivalent circuit shown are by definition linear and such non-linearity effects are not typically reflected in transformer equivalent circuits.[9]:142 With sinusoidal supply, core flux lags the induced EMF by 90°.

      "The EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.[9] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance. However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency. Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.[17] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g. 16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors. Consequently, the transformers used to step-down the high overhead line voltages were much larger and heavier for the same power rating than those required for the higher frequencies.\n",

      "\n",
      "Operation of a transformer at its designed voltage but at a higher frequency than intended will lead to reduced magnetizing current. At a lower frequency, the magnetizing current will increase. Operation of a large transformer at other than its design frequency may require assessment of voltages, losses, and cooling to establish if safe operation is practical. Transformers may require protective relays to protect the transformer from overvoltage at higher than rated frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "One example is in traction transformers used for electric multiple unit and high-speed train service operating across regions with different electrical standards. The converter equipment and traction transformers have to accommodate different input frequencies and voltage (ranging from as high as 50 Hz down to 16.7 Hz and rated up to 25 kV).\n",
      "\n",
      "At much higher frequencies the transformer core size required drops dramatically: a physically small transformer can handle power levels that would require a massive iron core at mains frequency. The development of switching power semiconductor devices made switch-mode power supplies viable, to generate a high frequency, then change the voltage level with a small transformer.\n",

      "Transformer energy losses are dominated by winding and core losses.[18] Transformers' efficiency tends to improve with increasing transformer capacity. The efficiency of typical distribution transformers is between about 98 and 99 percent.[19][20]\n",
      "\n",
      "As transformer losses vary with load, it is often useful to tabulate no-load loss, full-load loss, half-load loss, and so on. Hysteresis and eddy current losses are constant at all load levels and dominate at no load, while winding loss increases as load increases. The no-load loss can be significant, so that even an idle transformer constitutes a drain on the electrical supply. Designing energy efficient transformers for lower loss requires a larger core, good-quality silicon steel, or even amorphous steel for the core and thicker wire, increasing initial cost. The choice of construction represents a trade-off between initial cost and operating cost.[21]\n",

      "Winding joule losses Current flowing through a winding's conductor causes joule heating due to the resistance of the wire. As frequency increases, skin effect and proximity effect causes the winding's resistance and, hence, losses to increase. Core losses Hysteresis losses Each time the magnetic field is reversed, a small amount of energy is lost due to hysteresis within the core, caused by motion of the magnetic domains within the steel. According to Steinmetz's formula, the heat energy due to hysteresis is given by W h ≈ η β max 1.6 , {\\displaystyle W_{\\text{h}}\\approx \\eta \\beta _{\\text{max}}^{1.6},} hysteresis loss is thus given by P h ≈ W h f ≈ η f β max 1.6 {\\displaystyle P_{\\text{h}}\\approx {W}_{\\text{h}}f\\approx \\eta {f}\\beta _{\\text{max}}^{1.6}} where, f is the frequency, η is the hysteresis coefficient and β max is the maximum flux density, the empirical exponent of which varies from about 1.4 to 1.8 but is often given as 1.6 for iron.[21] For more detailed analysis, see Magnetic core and Steinmetz's equation. Eddy current losses Eddy currents are induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core. The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.[21] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.\n",

      "Magnetostriction related transformer hum Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the frictional energy of which produces an audible noise known as mains hum or \"transformer hum\".[22] This transformer hum is especially objectionable in transformers supplied at power frequencies and in high-frequency flyback transformers associated with television CRTs. Stray losses Leakage inductance is by itself largely lossless, since energy supplied to its magnetic fields is returned to the supply with the next half-cycle. However, any leakage flux that intercepts nearby conductive materials such as the transformer's support structure will give rise to eddy currents and be converted to heat.[23] Radiative There are also radiative losses due to the oscillating magnetic field but these are usually small. Mechanical vibration and audible noise transmission In addition to magnetostriction, the alternating magnetic field causes fluctuating forces between the primary and secondary windings. This energy incites vibration transmission in interconnected metalwork, thus amplifying audible transformer hum.[24]\n",

At higher voltage and power ratings, shell form transformers tend to be more prevalent.[25][26][27] Shell form design tends to be preferred for extra-high voltage and higher MVA applications because, though more labor-intensive to manufacture, shell form transformers are characterized as having inherently better kVA-to-weight ratio, better short-circuit strength characteristics and higher immunity to transit damage.[27]\n",

Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.[31] The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.[9]\n",

The cut-core or C-core type is made by winding a steel strip around a rectangular form and then bonding the layers together. It is then cut in two, forming two C shapes, and the core assembled by binding the two C halves together with a steel strap.[32] They have the advantage that the flux is always oriented parallel to the metal grains, reducing reluctance.\n",

The closed ring shape eliminates air gaps inherent in the construction of an E-I core.[9] :485 The cross-section of the ring is usually square or rectangular, but more expensive cores with circular cross-sections are also available. The primary and secondary coils are often wound concentrically to cover the entire surface of the core. This minimizes the length of wire needed and provides screening to minimize the core's magnetic field from generating electromagnetic interference.\n",

      "Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level. Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes. The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below). Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.\n",

A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding. This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil. As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon. Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10 kVA, and practically none above 25 kVA. Small distribution transformers may achieve some of the benefits of a toroidal core by splitting it and forcing it open, then inserting a bobbin containing primary and secondary windings.[37]\n",

The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that the average age of failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures.[44][45] Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure.[41] With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information.\n",

Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries. Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction.

The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.[62] Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.[63]\n",

Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments;[69] In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.[70]\n",

flux results in energy being alternately stored in and discharged from the magnetic fields with each cycle of the power supply.', 'It is not directly a power loss, but results in inferior voltage regulation, causing the secondary voltage not to be directly proportional to the primary voltage, particularly under heavy load.', '[11] Transformers are therefore normally designed to have very low leakage inductance.', 'In some applications increased leakage is desired, and long magnetic paths, air gaps, or magnetic bypass shunts may deliberately be introduced in a transformer design to limit

of frequency [ edit ]\\n\\nThe EMF of a transformer at a given flux increases with frequency.', '[9] By operating at higher frequencies, transformers can be physically more compact because a given core is able to transfer more power without reaching saturation and fewer turns are needed to achieve the same impedance.', 'However, properties such as core loss and conductor skin effect also increase with frequency.', 'Aircraft and military equipment employ 400 Hz power supplies which reduce core and winding weight.', '[17] Conversely, frequencies used for some railway electrification systems were much lower (e.g.', '16.7 Hz and 25 Hz) than normal utility frequencies (50–60 Hz) for historical reasons concerned mainly with the limitations of early electric traction motors.',

induced in the conductive metal transformer core by the changing magnetic field, and this current flowing through the resistance of the iron dissipates energy as heat in the core.', 'The eddy current loss is a complex function of the square of supply frequency and inverse square of the material thickness.', '[21] Eddy current losses can be reduced by making the core of a stack of laminations (thin plates) electrically insulated from each other, rather than a solid block; all transformers operating at low frequencies use laminated or similar cores.', 'Magnetostriction related transformer hum Magnetic flux in a ferromagnetic material, such as the core, causes it to physically expand and contract slightly with each cycle of the magnetic field, an effect known as magnetostriction, the

steel.', '[28] The steel has a permeability many times that of free space and the core thus serves to greatly reduce the magnetizing current and confine the flux to a path which closely couples the windings.', '[29] Early transformer developers soon realized that cores constructed from solid iron resulted in prohibitive eddy current losses, and their designs mitigated this effect with cores consisting of bundles of insulated iron wires.', '[30] Later designs constructed the core by stacking layers of thin steel laminations, a principle that has remained in use.', 'Each lamination is insulated from its neighbors by a thin non-conducting layer of insulation.', '[31] The transformer universal EMF equation can be used to calculate the core cross-sectional area for a preferred level of magnetic flux.', '[9]\\n\\nThe effect of laminations is to confine eddy currents to highly elliptical paths that enclose little flux, and so reduce their magnitude.', 'Thinner laminations reduce

removed.\", 'When power is then reapplied, the residual field will cause a high inrush current until the effect of the remaining magnetism is reduced, usually after a few cycles of the applied AC waveform.', '[33] Overcurrent protection devices such as fuses must be selected to allow this harmless inrush to pass.', 'On transformers connected to long, overhead power transmission lines, induced

interference.\", 'Toroidal transformers are more efficient than the cheaper laminated E-I types for a similar power level.', 'Other advantages compared to E-I types, include smaller size (about half), lower weight (about half), less mechanical hum (making them superior in audio amplifiers), lower exterior magnetic field (about one tenth), low off-load losses (making them more efficient in standby circuits), single-bolt mounting, and greater choice of shapes.', 'The main disadvantages are higher cost and limited power capacity (see Classification parameters below).', 'Because of the lack of a residual gap in the magnetic path, toroidal transformers also tend to exhibit higher inrush current, compared to laminated E-I types.', 'Ferrite toroidal cores are used at higher frequencies, typically between a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz, to reduce losses, physical size, and weight of inductive components.', 'A drawback of toroidal transformer construction is the higher labor cost of winding.', 'This is because it is necessary to pass the entire length of a coil winding through the core aperture each time a single turn is added to the coil.', 'As a consequence, toroidal transformers rated more than a few kVA are uncommon.', 'Relatively few toroids are offered with power ratings above 10 kVA, and practically none above 25 kVA.', 'Small

edit ]\\n\\n[53] Faraday's experiment with induction between coils of wire\\n\\nElectromagnetic induction, the principle of the operation of the transformer, was discovered independently by Michael Faraday in 1831 and Joseph Henry in 1832.\", \"[54][55][56][57] Only Faraday furthered his experiments to the point of working out the equation describing the relationship between EMF and magnetic flux now known as Faraday's law of induction:\\n\\n| E | = | d Φ B d t | , {\\\\displaystyle |{\\\\mathcal {E}}|=\\\\left|{{\\\\mathrm {d} \\\\Phi _{\\\\text{B}}} \\\\over \\\\mathrm {d} t}\\\\right|,}\\n\\nwhere | E | {\\\\displaystyle |{\\\\mathcal {E}}|} is the magnitude of the EMF in volts and Φ B is the magnetic flux through the circuit in webers.\", '[58]\\n\\nFaraday performed early experiments on induction between coils of wire, including winding a pair of coils around an iron ring, thus creating the first toroidal closed-core transformer.', '[57][59] However he only applied individual pulses of current to his transformer, and never discovered the relation between the turns ratio and EMF in the windings.', \"Induction coil, 1900, Bremerhaven, Germany\\n\\nInduction coils [ edit ]\\n\\nFaraday's ring transformer\\n\\nThe first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil, invented by Rev.\", 'Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College, Ireland in 1836.', '[57] He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding, the larger the induced secondary EMF will be.', \"Induction coils evolved from scientists' and inventors' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries.\", 'Since batteries produce direct current (DC) rather than AC, induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction.', 'Between the 1830s and the 1870s, efforts to build better induction coils, mostly by trial and error, slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers.', 'First alternating current transformers [ edit ]\\n\\nBy the 1870s, efficient generators producing alternating current (AC) were available, and it was found AC could power an induction coil directly, without an interrupter.', 'In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system based on a set of induction coils where the primary windings were connected to a source of AC.', \"The secondary windings could be connected to several 'electric candles' (arc lamps) of his own design.\", 'The coils Yablochkov employed functioned essentially as transformers.', '[60]\\n\\nIn 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began producing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary.', 'Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.', \"[57][61]\\n\\nLucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs first exhibited a device with an open iron core called a 'secondary generator' in London in 1882, then sold the idea to the Westinghouse company in the United States.\", '[30] They also exhibited the invention in Turin, Italy in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system.', '[62]\\n\\nEarly series circuit transformer distribution [ edit ]\\n\\nInduction coils with open magnetic circuits are inefficient at transferring power to loads.', 'Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit.', 'Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps.', 'The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit.', 'Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil.', '[62] Efficient, practical transformer designs did not appear until the 1880s, but within a decade, the transformer would be instrumental in the war of the currents, and in seeing AC distribution systems triumph over their DC counterparts, a position in which they have remained dominant ever since.', '[63]\\n\\n[62] Shell form transformer.', \"Sketch used by Uppenborn to describe ZBD engineers' 1885 patents and earliest articles.\", 'Core form, front; shell form, back.', 'Earliest specimens of ZBD-designed high-efficiency constant-potential transformers manufactured at the Ganz factory in 1885.', \"Stanley's 1886 design for adjustable gap open-core induction coils\\n\\nClosed-core transformers and parallel power distribution [ edit ]\\n\\nIn the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three Hungarian engineers associated with the Ganz Works, had determined that open-core devices were impracticable, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.\", '[61] In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around an iron wire ring core or surrounded by an iron wire core.', '[62] The two designs were the first application of the two basic transformer constructions in common use to this day, termed \"core form\" or \"shell form\" .', \"[64] The Ganz factory had also in the autumn of 1884 made delivery of the world's first five high-efficiency AC transformers, the first of these units having been shipped on September 16, 1884.\", '[65] This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.', '[65]\\n\\nIn both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see Toroidal cores below).', 'The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs.', '[66] The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 1,400 to 2,000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred).', '[67][68] When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.', 'Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments;[69] In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores.', '[70]\\n\\nTransformers today are designed on the principles discovered by the three engineers.', \"They also popularized the word 'transformer' to describe a device for altering the EMF of an electric current [71] although the term had already been in use by 1882.\", \"[72][73] In 1886, the ZBD engineers designed, and the Ganz factory supplied electrical equipment for, the world's first power station that used AC generators to power a parallel connected common electrical network, the steam-powered Rome-Cerchi power plant.\", '[74]\\n\\nWestinghouse improvements [ edit ]\\n\\n\"E\" shaped plates for transformer cores developed by Westinghouse\\n\\nAlthough George Westinghouse had bought Gaulard and Gibbs\\' patents in 1885, the Edison Electric Light Company held an option on the US rights for the ZBD transformers, requiring Westinghouse to pursue alternative designs on the same principles.', 'He assigned to William Stanley the task of developing a device for commercial use in United States.', \"[75] Stanley's first patented design was for induction coils with single cores of soft iron and adjustable gaps to regulate the EMF present in the secondary winding (see image).\", 'This design[76] was first used commercially in the US in 1886[77] but Westinghouse was intent on improving the Stanley design to make it (unlike the ZBD type) easy and cheap to produce.', \"[76]\\n\\nWestinghouse, Stanley and associates soon developed a core that was easier to manufacture, consisting of a stack of thin 'E‑shaped' iron plates insulated by thin sheets of paper or other insulating material.\", 'Pre-wound copper coils could then be slid into place, and straight iron plates laid in to create a closed magnetic circuit.', 'Westinghouse otained a patent for the new low-cost design in 1887.', \"[69]\\n\\nOther early transformer designs [ edit ]\\n\\nIn 1889, Russian-born engineer Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed the first three-phase transformer at the Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft ('General Electricity Company') in Germany.\", '[78]\\n\\nIn 1891, Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla coil, an air-cored, dual-tuned resonant transformer for producing very high voltages at high frequency.', '[79]\\n\\nAudio frequency transformers (\"repeating coils\") were used by early experimenters in the development of the telephone.', '[citation needed]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]\\n\\nNotes [ edit ]\\n\\n^ increase of magnetic flux linkages is opposite to the direction that would be given by the With turns of the winding oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines, the flux is the product of the magnetic flux density and the core area, the magnetic field varying with time according to the excitation of the primary.', 'The expression dΦ/dt, defined as the derivative of magnetic flux Φ with time t, provides a measure of rate of magnetic flux in the core and hence of EMF induced in the respective winding.', 'The negative sign in eq.', '1 & eq.', '2 is consistent with Lenz\\'s law and Faraday\\'s law in that by convention EMF \"induced by anof magnetic flux linkages isto the direction that would be given by the right-hand rule .\"', \"^ Although ideal transformer's winding inductances are each infinitely high, the square root of winding inductances' ratio is equal to the turns ratio.\", '^ [6] This also implies the following: The net core flux is zero, the input impedance is infinite when secondary is open and zero when secondary is shorted; there is zero phase-shift through an ideal transformer; input and output power and reactive volt-ampere are each conserved; these three statements apply for any frequency above zero and periodic waveforms are conserved.', '^ [14] Percent impedance is the ratio of the voltage drop in the secondary from no load to full load.', 'References [ edit ]\\n\\nBibliography [ edit ]\\n\\nGeneral
